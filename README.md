# gitHub_Repository_Manager

A Java-based CLI application that interacts with the GitHub API to manage repositories. This program:

    - Connects to a private GitHub account using credentials from a configuration file.
    - Lists all available repositories and allows the user to select one.
    - Creates a new branch, adds a Hello.txt file with "Hello world!" content, and commits the changes.
    - Updates the file if it already exists and creates or verifies the existence of a pull request for the changes.

The project demonstrates efficient use of GitHub's REST API with robust error handling, user interaction, and modular design.
